# WHY WE DO IT?
            # if we have a latge amount of data say "the data of previous 10 years", it
# become impossiible for us to understand the behaviour of data, yani us data ko dekh kr
# y btana bhhtt mushkil ho ga k kon s saal m ziada growth hui, is liye hm data visulaization
#  ko use krty hn , ta k hm graph k zrye easily bta skyn y vaty

# WHAT IS DATA VISULAIZATION?
            #  graphical representation of data

# TYPES OF DATA VISUALIZATION IN PYTHON:
            #  MATPLOTLIB
            #  PANDAS VISUALIZATION
            #  SEABORN
            #  GGPLOT
            #  PLOTLY


#                       MATPLOTLIB
# it was developed in 2002 by john hunter. matplotlib can priovide 2D and 3D graphs

# LINEAR PLOT
# SCATTER PLOT
# BAR PLOT
# STEM PLOT
# STEP PLOT
# HIST PLOT
# BOX PLOT
# PIE PLOT
# FILL BETWEEN PLOT
